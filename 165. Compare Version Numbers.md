# 165. Compare Version Numbers

[LeetCode 165](https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-version-numbers/)

## Problem

Compare two version numbers *version1* and *version2*.
If ```*version1* > *version2*``` return ```1;``` if ```*version1* < *version2*``` return ```-1;```otherwise return ```0```.

You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the `.` character.

The `.` character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.

For instance, `2.5` is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.

You may assume the default revision number for each level of a version number to be `0`. For example, version number `3.4` has a revision number of `3` and `4` for its first and second level revision number. Its third and fourth level revision number are both `0`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: version1 = "0.1", version2 = "1.1"
Output: -1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: version1 = "1.0.1", version2 = "1"
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: version1 = "7.5.2.4", version2 = "7.5.3"
Output: -1
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: version1 = "1.01", version2 = "1.001"
Output: 0
Explanation: Ignoring leading zeroes, both “01” and “001" represent the same number “1”
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: version1 = "1.0", version2 = "1.0.0"
Output: 0
Explanation: The first version number does not have a third level revision number, which means its third level revision number is default to "0"
```

 

**Note:**

1. Version strings are composed of numeric strings separated by dots `.` and this numeric strings **may** have leading zeroes.
2. Version strings do not start or end with dots, and they will not be two consecutive dots.

## Methods
Array Operation


### Code
```JavaScript
var arrayNonEmpty = (arr) => (Array.isArray(arr) && arr.length)

var compareVersion = function(version1, version2) {
    let v1 = version1.split('.').map(x => parseInt(x))
    let v2 = version2.split('.').map(x => parseInt(x))
    let v1_sub = 0
    let v2_sub = 0
    
    while (arrayNonEmpty(v1) && arrayNonEmpty(v2)) {
        v1_sub = v1.splice(0, 1)
        v2_sub = v2.splice(0, 1)
        if (v1_sub[0] > v2_sub[0]) return 1
        if (v1_sub[0] < v2_sub[0]) return -1
    }
    
    // if non-zero element left in v1, v1 is larger
    if (arrayNonEmpty(v1) && v1.reduce((total, x) => total + x)) return 1
    if (arrayNonEmpty(v2) && v2.reduce((total, x) => total + x)) return -1
    return 0
};
```
