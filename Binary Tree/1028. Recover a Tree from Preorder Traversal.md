# 1028. Recover a Tree From Preorder Traversal

[LeetCode 1028](https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-a-tree-from-preorder-traversal/)

## Problem

We run a preorder depth first search on the `root` of a binary tree.

At each node in this traversal, we output `D` dashes (where `D` is the *depth* of this node), then we output the value of this node. *(If the depth of a node is `D`, the depth of its immediate child is `D+1`. The depth of the root node is `0`.)*

If a node has only one child, that child is guaranteed to be the left child.

Given the output `S` of this traversal, recover the tree and return its `root`.
