# 332. Reconstruct Itinerary

[LeetCode 332](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/)

## Problem

Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports `[from, to]`, reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `JFK`. Thus, the itinerary must begin with `JFK`.

**Note:**

1. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.
2. All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
3. You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
4. One must use all the tickets once and only once.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
             But it is larger in lexical order.
```

## Methods
Intuition: 

Topological Sort = Reverse Postorder Traversal

```
		 1
		/ \
	 2   3
	/ \ 
 4	 5
 
 Postorder: 				[4, 5, 2, 3, 1]
 Reverse Postorder: [1, 3, 2, 5, 4]
```

We can see that in `Reverse Postorder traversal`, no prerequisites of a node occur after the node.


### Code
```JavaScript
/**
 * @param {string[][]} tickets
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var compare = function(a, b) {
    let ticket1 = a[0].concat(a[1]);
    let ticket2 = b[0].concat(b[1]);
    for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        if (ticket1[i] !== ticket2[i]) return ticket1[i].charCodeAt(0) - ticket2[i].charCodeAt(0);
    }
    return 0;
}

var findItinerary = function(tickets) {
    let targets = {};
    let sortedTickets = tickets.slice();
    // sort tickets in ascending order so that lexicographically greater tickets will appear later in the routej
    sortedTickets.sort((a, b) => compare(a, b));
    for (let ticket of sortedTickets) {
        let [start, end] = ticket;
        if (start in targets) {
            targets[start].push(end);
        } else {
            targets[start] = [end];
        }
    }
    let route = [];
    
    // traverse the graph to find a possible route until we come to the end node
    // the lexicographical order is guaranteed by the sorting process
    // the topological order is maintained by bottom-up pushing manner
    var visit = function(airport) {
        // console.log(airport, targets[airport])
        while (targets[airport] && targets[airport].length > 0) {
            visit(targets[airport].shift());
        }
        route.push(airport);
    }
    visit('JFK');
    return route.reverse();
};

```
