# 45. Jump Game II

[LeetCode 45](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/)

## Problem

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

**Example:**

```
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
    Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

**Note:**

You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

## Methods
### Method 1: Greedy

Intuition: 

Imagine that you are a real jumper.

You jump from current position to some position on the right side.

You always want to jump to the position that can make your next jump destination farthest.

Iteratively do this greedy strategy until the destination reaches the end.


### Code
```JavaScript
// greedy
var jump = function(nums) {
  	// edge case
    if (nums.length <= 1) return 0;
    
    let left = 0, right = nums[0];
    let farthest = right;
    let times = 1;
    
    while (right < nums.length - 1) {
        times++;
        for (let i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            farthest = Math.max(farthest, i + nums[i]);
        }
        [left, right] = [right, farthest];
    }
    
    return times;
}
```
