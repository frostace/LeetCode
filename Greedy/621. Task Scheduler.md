# 621. Task Scheduler

[LeetCode 621](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/)

## Problem

You are given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done without the original order of the array. Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative integer `n` that represents the cooldown period between two **same tasks** (the same letter in the array), that is that there must be at least `n` units of time between any two same tasks.

You need to return the **least** number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: 
A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
There is at least 2 units of time between any two same tasks.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0
Output: 6
Explanation: On this case any permutation of size 6 would work since n = 0.
["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
["A","B","A","B","A","B"]
["B","B","B","A","A","A"]
...
And so on.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], n = 2
Output: 16
Explanation: 
One possible solution is
A -> B -> C -> A -> D -> E -> A -> F -> G -> A -> idle -> idle -> A -> idle -> idle -> A
```

 **Constraints:**

- The number of tasks is in the range `[1, 10000]`.
- The integer `n` is in the range `[0, 100]`.

## Methods

### Greedy Approach

Intuition: 

* It comes to me that we should first deal with the most difficult tasks

  * well, how to define `difficult`?
  * here we only have one property to measure the difficulty of allocating tasks - `frequency`
  * and by instinct, yes, more frequent tasks are more difficult to allocate since we have to leave more space for them

* so, let's say we allocate tasks ordered by frequency

  ```text
  [ A, A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C, D, D, E, E], n = 2
  sort by frequency [(A, 3), (B, 3), (C, 3), (D, 2), (E, 2)]
  
  insert A: [ A, *, *, A, *, *, A ]  so that A is not breaking the rule
      here, * means idle units
      we want to execute every task while minimizing idle units
      so for any task coming after A, we take up those idle units first
  question 1: how to ensure that later tasks also meet the CPU interval rule?
  		the frequency of any letter K after A must have: freq[K] <= freq[A]
  		so we just allocate them like this [ A, K, *, A, K, *, A, (K) ]
  		it shall never break the rule
  question 2: what if all idle units are taken?
  		no problem either according to the previous explanation
  
  insert B: [ A, B, *, A, B, *, A, B ]
  insert C: [ A, B, C, A, B, C, A, B, C ]
  insert whatever left: [ A, B, C, (), A, B, C, (), A, B, C, () ]
  it won't cause problem if we just insert letters into the gaps illustrated above
  and it won't produce any idle unit either
  
  done!
```
  

### Code

JavaScript

```JavaScript
var leastInterval = function(tasks, n) {
    let counter = {};
    for (let task of tasks) {
        counter[task] = (task in counter) ? counter[task] + 1 : 1;
    }
    
    let freq = [];
    for (let task in counter) {
        freq.push([task, counter[task]]);
    }
    
    freq.sort((task1, task2) => task2[1] - task1[1]);
    
    let intervals = (freq.shift()[1] - 1);
    let idleTime = intervals * n;
    for (let [task, f] of freq) {
        idleTime -= Math.min(intervals, f);
        if (idleTime <= 0) {
            idleTime = 0;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return tasks.length + idleTime;
}
```
