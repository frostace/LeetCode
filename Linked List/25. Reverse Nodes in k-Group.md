# 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

[LeetCode 25](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/)

## Problem

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list *k* at a time and return its modified list.

*k* is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of *k* then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

**Example:**

Given this linked list: `1->2->3->4->5`

For *k* = 2, you should return: `2->1->4->3->5`

For *k* = 3, you should return: `3->2->1->4->5`

**Note:**

- Only constant extra memory is allowed.
- You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

## Methods

### Recursive + Iterative

Intuition: 
Recurse Groups + Iteratively reverse each node in each group
* divide linked list to first k nodes and rest nodes
* maintain head and tail in the current group
- if #nodes in this group < k:
  * return head directly
- else:
  * iteratively reverse first k nodes
  * head.next = dfs(next_group)
  * return tail

### Code

```JavaScript
var reverseKGroup = function(curr, k) {
    // iteratively reverse nodes until count = k
    // note: #nodes to reverse = k, #links to reverse = k - 1
    let count = 1
    let prev = null
    let currTail = null
    let currHead = curr
    
    // base case: no enough nodes in this group
    // first iterate to test group length
    let pointer = curr
    while (pointer !== null) {
        count += 1
        pointer = pointer.next
    }
    if (count <= k) return currHead
    
    // then iterate to reverse
    count = 1
    while (count <= k && curr !== null) {
        // store tail in the current group
        if (count === 1) currTail = curr
        
        count += 1
        
        // step ahead next
        const next = curr.next
        
        // reverse link
        curr.next = prev
        
        // step ahead prev and curr
        prev = curr
        curr = next
    }
    
    // recurse
    // concatenate with head in current group with tail in previous group
    currTail.next = reverseKGroup(curr, k)
    
    return prev
};
```
